## Summary

- Solana **programs** are comprised of **instruction handlers**, which execute
  the program's logic.
- [**Rust**](https://doc.rust-lang.org) is the most common language for building
  Solana programs. The [**Anchor**](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) framework
  streamlines the development process by automating tasks like data
  deserialization and account validation, allowing developers to focus on the
  core logic of their program.

## Lesson

Solana's ability to run arbitrary executable code is part of what makes it so
powerful. Solana programs, much like "smart contracts" in other blockchains,
form the foundation of the ecosystem. Developers continually expand this
collection of programs as they create and deploy new solutions using programs.

Before starting this lesson, you should have a basic understanding of the Rust
programming language. You can learn the fundamentals from
[The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

This lesson introduces the basics of writing and deploying a Solana program
using the Rust programming language and the Anchor framework.

### What is Anchor?

Anchor simplifies Solana development by automating common tasks such as account
validation and deserialization. It reduces boilerplate code, making programs
easier to write, understand, and maintain. As a result, it's become the "go-to"
framework for many developers in the Solana ecosystem.

### Anchor program structure

Anchor uses macros and traits to streamline the process of writing Solana
programs. These provide a clear structure to your program so you can more easily
reason about your code. The main high-level macros and attributes are:

- `declare_id()` - a macro for declaring the program's onchain address
- `#[program]` - an attribute macro used to mark the module containing
  instruction handlers.
- `Accounts` - a trait applied to structs for defining the required accounts for
  instructions.
- `#[account]` - an attribute macro used to mark structs as account types,
  providing serialization, ownership, and discriminator checks.

If you'd like to dive deeper into understanding the Anchor framework, you can
refer to [The Anchor Book](https://book.anchor-lang.com/).

Let's talk about each of them before putting all the pieces together.

### Declare your program ID

The
[`declare_id!()`](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/macro.declare_program.html)
macro specifies the onchain address (or `programId`) of your program. When
building an Anchor program for the first time, a new keypair is generated, which
becomes the program's default keypair used to deploy the program unless
specified otherwise. The corresponding public key should be used as the
`programId` specified in the `declare_id!()` macro.

```rust
declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");
```

### Define Instruction Handler Logic

Anchor's
[`#[program]`](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/attr.program.html)
attribute defines the module containing all instruction handlers defining all
entries into a Solana program. Each instruction handler receives a `Context`
type parameter, which provides instruction metadata and account information.
Additional instruction handler parameters can represent instruction data, which
Anchor automatically deserializes, allowing you to work with instruction data as
native Rust types.

```rust
#[program]
mod program_module_name {
    use super::*;

    pub fn instruction_one(ctx: Context<InstructionAccounts>, instruction_data: u64) -> Result<()> {
    ctx.accounts.account_name.data = instruction_data;
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

#### Understand the Instruction Handler Context

The
[`Context`](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/context/struct.Context.html)
type is a generic structure that provides access to the accounts and metadata
required for an instruction handler.

```rust
pub struct Context<'a, 'b, 'c, 'info, T: Bumps> {
    /// Currently executing program id.
    pub program_id: &'a Pubkey,
    /// Deserialized accounts.
    pub accounts: &'b mut T,
    /// Remaining accounts given but not deserialized or validated.
    /// Be very careful when using this directly.
    pub remaining_accounts: &'c [AccountInfo<'info>],
    /// Bump seeds found during constraint validation. This is provided as a
    /// convenience so that handlers don't have to recalculate bump seeds or
    /// pass them in as arguments.
    /// Type is the bumps struct generated by #[derive(Accounts)]
    pub bumps: T::Bumps,
}
```

`Context` is a generic type where `T` defines the list of accounts an
instruction handler requires. The `T` type must implement the `Accounts` trait,
which is typically derived using the `#[derive(Accounts)]` macro. When you use
`Context`, you specify the concrete type of `T` as a struct that adopts the
`Accounts` trait (e.g., `Context<MyAccounts>`). Through this context argument,
the instruction handler can access:

- The accounts passed into the instruction (`ctx.accounts`)
- The program ID (`ctx.program_id`) of the executing program
- The remaining accounts (`ctx.remaining_accounts`), which are the accounts
  passed into the instruction but not declared in the `Accounts` struct
- The bumps for any PDA accounts in the `Accounts` struct (`ctx.bumps`)

```rust
pub fn add_movie_review(ctx: Context<AddMovieReviewAccounts>, rating: u8, description: String) -> Result<()> {
    let movie_review = &mut ctx.accounts.movie_review;
    let movie = &ctx.accounts.movie;
    let reviewer = &ctx.accounts.reviewer;
    let clock = &ctx.accounts.clock;

    // Set the movie review data
    movie_review.rating = rating;
    movie_review.description = description;
    movie_review.movie = movie.key();
    movie_review.reviewer = reviewer.key();
    movie_review.created_at = clock.unix_timestamp;

    // Increment the movie's review count
    movie.review_count += 1;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Define Instruction Accounts

The
[`Accounts`](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/trait.Accounts.html)
trait defines a data structure for validated accounts required by an instruction
handler. Structs that implement this trait specify the accounts an instruction
handler needs, which are exposed through the `Context` type, eliminating the
need for manual account iteration and deserialization.

Typically, you apply the `Accounts` trait using the `derive` macro (e.g.
[`#[derive(Accounts)]`](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/derive.Accounts.html)).
This automatically implements an `Accounts` deserializer on the struct, so each
account doesn't need to be deserialized manually.

Implementations of the `Accounts` trait are responsible for executing constraint
checks to verify that the provided accounts meet the necessary conditions for
secure program execution. These constraints are applied to each field using the
`#account(..)` attribute.

For instance, an instruction handler `instruction_one` uses a `Context`
parameter of type `InstructionAccounts`. The `#[derive(Accounts)]` macro
implements the `InstructionAccounts` struct, which contains the following
accounts: `account_name`, `user`, and `system_program`.

```rust
// Constants
pub const DISCRIMINATOR_SIZE: usize = 8;

#[program]
pub mod program_module_name {
    use super::*;

    pub fn instruction_one(ctx: Context<InstructionAccounts>, instruction_data: u64) -> Result<()> {
        // Instruction handler logic goes here
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct InstructionAccounts<'info> {
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = user,
        space = DISCRIMINATOR_SIZE + AccountStruct::INIT_SPACE
    )]
    pub account_name: Account<'info, AccountStruct>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct AccountStruct {
    pub data: u64,
}
```

When `instruction_one` is invoked, the program using the Anchor framework:

- Verifies that the accounts passed into the instruction match the account types
  specified in the `InstructionAccounts` struct.
- Checks the accounts against any additional constraints specified in the
  `account` attributes.
- Initializes the `account_name` account if it doesn't exist, using the `user`
  as the payer.
- Allocates the correct amount of space for the `account_name` account, which
  includes the 8-byte discriminator(`DISCRIMINATOR_SIZE`) and the space required
  by `AccountStruct`.

If any accounts passed into the `instruction_one` instruction handler fail the
account validation or security checks specified in the `InstructionAccounts`
struct, the execution fails before reaching the custom logic within the
`instruction_one` function.

### Account Validation

You may have noticed in the previous example that one of the accounts in
`InstructionAccounts` was of type `Account`, one was of type `Signer`, and one
was of type `Program`.

Anchor provides a number of account types that can be used to represent
accounts. Each type implements different account validation. We'll go over a few
of the common types you may encounter, but be sure to look through the
[full list of account types](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/accounts/index.html).

#### Account

[`Account`](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/accounts/account/struct.Account.html)
is a wrapper
aroundÂ [`UncheckedAccount`](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/accounts/unchecked_account/struct.UncheckedAccount.html)
that verifies program ownership and deserializes the underlying data into a Rust
type.

```rust
// Deserializes this info
pub struct UncheckedAccount<'a> {
    pub key: &'a Pubkey,
    pub is_signer: bool,
    pub is_writable: bool,
    pub lamports: Rc<RefCell<&'a mut u64>>,
    pub data: Rc<RefCell<&'a mut [u8]>>,    // <---- deserializes account data
    pub owner: &'a Pubkey,    // <---- checks owner program
    pub executable: bool,
    pub rent_epoch: u64,
}
```

In the previous example, the `InstructionAccounts` struct contained the
following field:

```rust
pub account_name: Account<'info, AccountStruct>
```

The `Account` wrapper is responsible for:

- Deserializing the account `data` into the specified type (`AccountStruct`).
- Verifying that the account's program owner matches the program owner required
  for the `AccountStruct` type.

When the account type inside the `Account` wrapper is defined within the same
crate using the `#[account]` attribute macro, the program ownership check
ensures that the account is owned by the program ID specified in the
`declare_id!()` macro.

The following checks are performed to validate the account:

```rust
// Checks performed
Account.info.owner == T::owner() // Ensures the account is owned by the correct program
!(Account.info.owner == SystemProgram && Account.info.lamports() == 0) // Ensures the account is not uninitialized
```

#### Signer

The
[`Signer`](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/accounts/signer/struct.Signer.html)
type validates that the given account signed the transaction. No other ownership
or type checks are done. You should only use the `Signer` when the underlying
account data is not required in the instruction.

For the `user` account in the previous example, the `Signer` type specifies that
the `user` account must be a signer of the instruction.

The following check is performed for you:

```rust
// Checks performed
Signer.info.is_signer == true
```

#### Program

The
[`Program`](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/accounts/program/struct.Program.html)
type ensures that an account is a specific program.

In the previous example, the `system_program` account used the `Program` type to
validate that the account corresponds to the system program. Anchor provides a
`System` type that includes the `programId` of the system program, which is used
for validation.

```rust
// Checks performed
account_info.key == expected_program     // Ensures the account is the expected program
account_info.executable == true          // Ensures the account is executable
```

### Add Constraints with #[account(..)]

The
[`#[account(..)]`](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/derive.Accounts.html#normal-constraints)
attribute macro applies constraints to accounts. While this example covers a few
constraint cases, you can refer to the full
[list of possible `#[account(..)]` constraints](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/derive.Accounts.html)
for further details.

Here's a recall of the `account_name` field from the `InstructionAccounts`
example:

```rust
#[account(
    init,
    payer = user,
    space = DISCRIMINATOR_SIZE + AccountStruct::INIT_SPACE
)]
pub account_name: Account<'info, AccountStruct>,
#[account(mut)]
pub user: Signer<'info>,
```

The `#[account(..)]` attribute includes three comma-separated values:

- `init` - Initializes the account by creating it through a CPI to the system
  program and setting its discriminator.
- `payer` - Specifies the `user` account as the payer for the account
  initialization.
- `space`- Allocates space for the account as
  `DISCRIMINATOR_SIZE + AccountStruct::INIT_SPACE`. The discriminator occupies
  the first 8 bytes, and the remaining space is allocated for the account data
  based on `AccountStruct`.

For `user` we use the `#[account(..)]` attribute to specify that the given
account is mutable. The `user` account must be marked as mutable because
lamports will be deducted from the account to pay for the initialization of
`account_name`.

The `#[account(mut)]` attribute is applied to `user`, marking the account as
mutable, as lamports are deducted from `user` to pay for the initialization of
`account_name`.

```rust
#[account(mut)]
pub user: Signer<'info>,
```

<Callout>

The `init` constraint placed on `account_name` automatically includes a `mut`
constraint so that both `account_name` and `user` are mutable accounts.
</Callout>

### Attribute #[account]

The `#[account]` attribute is applied to structs representing the data structure
of a Solana account. It implements the following traits:

- `AccountSerialize`
- `AccountDeserialize`
- `AnchorSerialize`
- `AnchorDeserialize`
- `Clone`
- `Discriminator`
- `Owner`

You can read more about the
[details of each trait of `#[account]`](https://docs.rs/anchor-lang/latest/anchor_lang/attr.account.html),
but here's the key takeaway: the `#[account]` attribute enables serialization
and deserialization, and implements the discriminator and owner traits for an
account.

The discriminator is an 8-byte unique identifier derived from the first 8 bytes
of the SHA256 hash of the account type's name. This discriminator is reserved
for the first 8 bytes when implementing account serialization traits, which is
standard in Anchor programs.

When `AccountDeserialize`'s `try_deserialize` is called, it checks the
discriminator. If the discriminator doesn't match, it indicates an invalid
account, and the deserialization exits with an error.

The `#[account]` attribute also implements the `Owner` trait, setting the
account owner to the `programId` declared by `declareId` in the crate. Any
account initialized using an account type defined with the `#[account]`
attribute is owned by the program.

For example, in `InstructionAccounts`, `account_name` uses the `AccountStruct`:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct InstructionAccounts {
    #[account(init, payer = user, space = 8 + 8)]
    pub account_name: Account<'info, AccountStruct>,
    ...
}

#[account]
pub struct AccountStruct {
    data: u64
}
```

The `#[account]` attribute ensures that it can be used as an account in
`InstructionAccounts`.

When the `account_name` account is initialized:

- The first 8 bytes are set as the `AccountStruct` discriminator.
- The account data field matches `AccountStruct`.
- The account owner is set to the `programId` from `declare_id!()`.

### Bring it all together

By combining these Anchor types, you can create a complete program. Here's an
example of a basic Anchor program with a single instruction handler that:

- Initializes a new account
- Updates the account's `data` field with the instruction data passed into the
  instruction handler

```rust
// Use this import to gain access to common anchor features
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

// Program onchain address
declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

pub const DISCRIMINATOR_SIZE: usize = 8;

#[program]
mod program_module_name {
    use super::*;
    // Instruction handler logic
    pub fn instruction_one(ctx: Context<InstructionAccounts>, instruction_data: u64) -> Result<()> {
        ctx.accounts.account_name.data = instruction_data;
        Ok(())
    }
}

// Validate incoming accounts for instructions
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct InstructionAccounts<'info> {
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = user,
        space = DISCRIMINATOR_SIZE + AccountStruct::INIT_SPACE
    )]
    pub account_name: Account<'info, AccountStruct>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

// Define custom program account type
#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct AccountStruct {
    pub data: u64
}
```

You are now ready to build your own Solana program using the Anchor framework!

## Lab

Before we begin, install Anchor by
[following the steps from the Anchor docs](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)
or the
[local setup lesson](/content/courses/onchain-development/local-setup.md).

For this lab we'll create a simple counter program with two instructions:

- The first instruction will initialize an account to store our counter
- The second instruction will increment the count stored in the counter

### 1. Setup

Create a new project called `anchor-counter` by running `anchor init`:

```shell
anchor init anchor-counter
```

Change into the new directory, then run `anchor build`

```shell
cd anchor-counter
anchor build
```

Anchor build will also generate a keypair for your new program - the keys are
saved in the `target/deploy` directory.

Open the file `lib.rs` and look at `declare_id!()`:

```rust
declare_id!("BouTUP7a3MZLtXqMAm1NrkJSKwAjmid8abqiNjUyBJSr");
```

Run `anchor keys sync`

```shell
anchor keys sync
```

You'll see the Anchor updates both:

- The key used in `declare_id!()` in `lib.rs`
- The key in `Anchor.toml`

To match the key generated during `anchor build`:

```shell
Found incorrect program id declaration in "anchor-counter/programs/anchor-counter/src/lib.rs"
Updated to BouTUP7a3MZLtXqMAm1NrkJSKwAjmid8abqiNjUyBJSr

Found incorrect program id declaration in Anchor.toml for the program `anchor_counter`
Updated to BouTUP7a3MZLtXqMAm1NrkJSKwAjmid8abqiNjUyBJSr

All program id declarations are synced.
```

Finally, delete the default code in `lib.rs` until all that is left is the
following:

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("your-private-key");

#[program]
pub mod anchor_counter {
    use super::*;

}
```

### 2. Implement Counter

First, let's use the `#[account]` attribute to define a new `Counter` account
type. The `Counter` struct defines one `count` field of type `u64`. This means
that we can expect any new accounts initialized as a `Counter` type to have a
matching data structure. The `#[account]` attribute also automatically sets the
discriminator for a new account and sets the owner of the account as the
`programId` from the `declare_id!()` macro. Add a custom error `ErrorCode` enum
for better error handling and reporting.

```rust
#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct Counter {
    pub count: u64,
}

#[error_code]
pub enum ErrorCode {
    #[msg("Math operation overflow")]
    Overflow,
}
```

### 3. Implement Context type Initialize

Next, using the `#[derive(Accounts)]` macro, let's implement the `Initialize`
type that lists and validates the accounts used by the `initialize` instruction.
It'll need the following accounts:

- `counter` - the counter account initialized in the instruction
- `user` - payer for the initialization
- `system_program` - the system program is required for the initialization of
  any new accounts

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = user,
        space = DISCRIMINATOR_SIZE + Counter::INIT_SPACE,
    )]
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

### 4. Add the initialize Instruction Handler

Now that we have our `Counter` account and `Initialize` type, let's implement
the `initialize` instruction handler within `#[program]`. This instruction
handler requires a `Context` of type `Initialize` and takes no additional
instruction data. In the instruction handler logic, we are simply setting the
`counter` account's `count` field to `0`.

```rust
pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
    let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
    counter.count = 0;
    msg!("Counter account created. Current count: {}", counter.count);
    Ok(())
}
```

### 5. Implement Context type Update

Now, using the `#[derive(Accounts)]` macro again, let's create the `Update`
struct that lists the accounts that the `increment` instruction handler
requires. It'll need the following accounts:

- `counter` - an existing counter account to increment
- `user` - payer for the transaction fee

Again, we'll need to specify any constraints using the `#[account(..)]`
attribute:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Update<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>,
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
}
```

### 6. Add increment Instruction Handler

Lastly, within `#[program]`, let's implement an `increment` instruction handler
to increment the `count` once a `counter` account is initialized by the first
instruction. This instruction handler requires a `Context` of type `Update`
(implemented in the next step) and takes no additional instruction data. In the
instruction handler logic, we are simply incrementing an existing `counter`
account's `count` field by `1`.

```rust
pub fn increment(ctx: Context<Update>) -> Result<()> {
    let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
    msg!("Previous counter: {}", counter.count);
    counter.count = counter.count.checked_add(1).ok_or(ErrorCode::Overflow)?;
    msg!("Counter incremented. Current count: {}", counter.count);
    Ok(())
}
```

### 7. Build

Altogether, the complete program will look like this:

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

declare_id!("Arf2LET7mchncY1Z24eZz71sqoPaFAb1RMtXeUvuET61");

pub const DISCRIMINATOR_SIZE: usize = 8;

#[program]
pub mod anchor_counter {
    use super::*;

    pub fn initialize(ctx: Context<Initialize>) -> Result<()> {
        let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        counter.count = 0;
        msg!("Counter account created. Current count: {}", counter.count);
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn increment(ctx: Context<Update>) -> Result<()> {
        let counter = &mut ctx.accounts.counter;
        msg!("Previous counter: {}", counter.count);
        counter.count = counter.count.checked_add(1).ok_or(ErrorCode::Overflow)?;
        msg!("Counter incremented. Current count: {}", counter.count);
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize<'info> {
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = user,
        space = DISCRIMINATOR_SIZE + Counter::INIT_SPACE,
    )]
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Update<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub counter: Account<'info, Counter>,
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
}

#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct Counter {
    pub count: u64,
}

#[error_code]
pub enum ErrorCode {
    #[msg("Math operation overflow")]
    Overflow,
}
```

Run `anchor build` to build the program.

### 8. Testing

Anchor tests are typically Typescript integration tests that use the Mocha test
framework. We'll learn more about testing later, but for now, navigate to
`anchor-counter.ts` and replace the default test code with the following:

```typescript
import * as anchor from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { Program } from "@coral-xyz/anchor";
import { expect } from "chai";
import { AnchorCounter } from "../target/types/anchor_counter";
import { PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

describe("Anchor counter", () => {
  const provider = anchor.AnchorProvider.env();
  anchor.setProvider(provider);

  const program = anchor.workspace.AnchorCounter as Program<AnchorCounter>;
  const counterKeypair = anchor.web3.Keypair.generate();
  let counterPubkey: PublicKey;

  before(async () => {
    counterPubkey = counterKeypair.publicKey;
  });

  it("initializes the counter", async () => {});

  it("increments the count", async () => {});
});
```

The above code generates a new keypair for the `counter` account we'll be
initializing and creates placeholders for a test of each instruction handler.

Next, create the first test for the `initialize` instruction handler:

```typescript
it("initializes the counter", async () => {
  try {
    await program.methods
      .initialize()
      .accounts({
        counter: counterPubkey,
        user: provider.wallet.publicKey,
      })
      .signers([counterKeypair])
      .rpc();

    const account = await program.account.counter.fetch(counterPubkey);
    expect(account.count.toNumber()).to.equal(0);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Initialization failed:", error);
    throw error;
  }
});
```

Next, create the second test for the `increment` instruction handler:

```typescript
it("increments the count", async () => {
  try {
    await program.methods
      .increment()
      .accounts({
        counter: counterPubkey,
        user: provider.wallet.publicKey,
      })
      .rpc();

    const account = await program.account.counter.fetch(counterPubkey);
    expect(account.count.toNumber()).to.equal(1);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Increment failed:", error);
    throw error;
  }
});
```

Lastly, run `anchor test` and you should see the following output:

```shell
 Anchor counter
    â initializes the counter (506ms)
    â increments the count (422ms)


 2 passing (929ms)
```

Running `anchor test` automatically spins up a local test validator, deploys
your program, and runs your mocha tests against it. Don't worry if you're
confused by the tests for now - we'll dig in more later.

Congratulations, you just built a Solana program using the Anchor framework!
Feel free to reference the
[solution code](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-counter-program/tree/solution-increment)
if you need some more time with it.

## Challenge

Now it's your turn to build something independently. Because we're starting with
simple programs, yours will look almost identical to what we just created. It's
useful to try and get to the point where you can write it from scratch without
referencing prior code, so try not to copy and paste it here.

1. Write a new program that initializes a `counter` account
2. Implement both an `increment` and `decrement` instruction handlers
3. Build and deploy your program like we did in the lab
4. Test your newly deployed program and use Solana Explorer to check the program
   logs

As always, get creative with these challenges and take them beyond the basic
instructions if you want - and have fun!

Try to do this independently if you can! But if you get stuck, feel free to
reference
theÂ [solution code](https://github.com/solana-developers/anchor-counter-program/tree/solution-decrement).
