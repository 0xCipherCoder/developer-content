title: How to Approach the Program Security Course
objectives:
  - Understand how to approach the Program Security Course
description:
  "Learn how to think intelligently about security for your onchain programs,
  whether developing in Anchor or Native Rust."

## Overview

This course aims to introduce you to a range of common security exploits unique
to Solana development. We’ve modeled this course heavily on Coral's
[Sealevel Attacks](https://github.com/coral-xyz/sealevel-attacks) repository.

Program security is covered in our
[Anchor](/content/courses/onchain-development.md) and
[Native Rust](/content/courses/native-onchain-development.md) development
courses to ensure that anyone deploying programs to Mainnet has at least a basic
understanding of security. If that’s you, the fundamental principles you learned
in those lessons should help you avoid some common Solana exploits on your own.

This course builds on those courses with two main goals:

1. Expand your awareness of the Solana programming model and highlight areas
   where you need to focus to close security loopholes.
2. Introduce you to the tools provided by Anchor to help keep your programs
   secure.

If you completed the Basic Security lesson, the first few topics in this module
should feel familiar, as they cover similar concepts. However, as you progress,
you’ll encounter new types of attacks. We encourage you to explore all of them.

One key point to note is that this course contains more lessons than previous
ones. The lessons are less interdependent, allowing you more flexibility to
explore topics in the order that suits you best.

Initially, we intended to create shorter lessons, but even though each security
vulnerability may seem "simple," there's a lot to discuss. Consequently, each
lesson may contain less prose and more code snippets, offering readers the
flexibility to dive as deep as they want. Ultimately, each lesson remains
comprehensive, ensuring you gain a solid understanding of the security risks
discussed.

As always, your feedback is appreciated. Good luck as you delve into the course!
